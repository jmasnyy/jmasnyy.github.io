**Dream pop** is a genre of music which aims to blend several genres like alt-rock, psychadelic rock, and others to create something new. It is known for its use of reverb, chorus, and many other effects to achieve its iconic dream-like sound. 


## Early History
In its early years, music that would eventually be referred to as "Dream Pop" often took inspiration from the [post-punk and psychedelic](https://rxmusic.com/editorial/rx-music-genre-breakdown-dream-pop/) bands of the 60s, 70s and 80s. Also referred to as alt-rock, Scottish band [Cocteau Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocteau_Twins) pioneered the early dream pop sound through their unique, "dreamy" sound, aided by sometimes nonsensical vocals and a multitude of reverb and chorus effects. British band Slowdive came onto the scene in the early 90s with hazy, nostalgic soundscapes that are often interchangably described as both [shoegaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze) and dream pop. Although these two genres share much in common (and lots of music can be described as both), shoegaze leans further into a hazy, alt-rock style than dream pop. 

## Contemporary Dream Pop
One of the most prominent dream pop bands of the past 20 years is Beach House, [formed in 2004](https://www.subpop.com/artists/beach_house). With the release of their first album in 2006, self titled *Beach House*, the sound of popular dream pop music shifted from alt-rock inspired to something more mellow. Since then, the band has release 8 full length studio albums, the most recent of which titled *Once Twice Melody*, released in 2022.
